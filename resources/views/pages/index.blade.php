        <h1>Welcome To Briansteins website!</h1>
        <p> This website is designed on the Laravel framework which is a MVC PHP framework which makes it easy
            to produce beautiful secure websites quickly and easily. It does this by providing boiler plate code,
            and a multitude of features for anything you need. Some of the most important features are the
            authentication system, the migrations for databases and the middleware access controls.
            On the navigation bar you will find a selection of my projects and functions available on the website
            and the protocols implemented.</p>
