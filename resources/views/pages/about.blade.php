    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am a logical individual who loves learning new things and programming. I graduated Keele university with a 2.1
        Bsc in Mathematics and Physics. Since then I have done a number of volunteering roles and tutoring roles while
        teaching myself to program through online courses.
        As I was not qualified to program as a job back then and I had gained significant experience teaching I then
        applied for the postgraduate certificate in secondary education teaching Mathematics and Physics at secondary
        school.
        <br />
        I gained a lot from this course including teamwork, essay writing, working to tight deadlines under a lot of
        pressure and how to communicate effectively to people of different knowledge and personalities.
        <br />
        It is programming which is my passion and has been since I started teaching myself straight after university.
        I love the ability to create any technology I can imagine</p>
