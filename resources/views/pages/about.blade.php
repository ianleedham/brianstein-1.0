    <p>I am a logical individual who loves learning new things and programming. I graduated Keele university with a 2.1
        Bsc in Mathematics and Physics. Since then I have done a number of volunteering roles and tutoring roles while
        teaching myself to program through online courses.
        As I was not qualified to program as a job back then and I had gained significant experience teaching I then
        applied for the postgraduate certificate in secondary education teaching Mathematics and Physics at secondary
        school.

        I gained a lot from this course including teamwork, essay writing, working to tight deadlines under a lot of
        pressure and how to communicate effectively to people of different knowledge and personalities.

        I gained a lot from the PGCE however I believe teaching is not my future as it is programming which is my
        passion and has been since I started teaching myself straight after university.</p>
